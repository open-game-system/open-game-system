Retired 2026-10-06: `cast-session-api.feature` (v1 `/api/v1/cast/*`) and
`cast-stream-rendering.feature` (one Cloudflare Container per cast), with the code they described
(ADR 2026-10-06-streaming-cloud-run-only). The 2026-03 `cast-session-lifecycle`,
`cast-state-updates` and `cast-to-tv-streaming` files still mention that API in places; the
current cast flow is `cast-first-app`, `cast-receiver-e2e` and `tv-switching`.

## Relationship to Product Specs

Product specs (prose) -> Acceptance tests (Gherkin) -> E2E tests (runnable)

When requirements change:
1. Update the product spec (the intent)
2. Update or create the `.feature` file (the contract)
3. Failing acceptance tests drive the implementation change
