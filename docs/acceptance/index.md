Gherkin scenarios defining the behavioral contract of the system.

## Relationship to Product Specs

Product specs (prose) -> Acceptance tests (Gherkin) -> E2E tests (runnable)

When requirements change:
1. Update the product spec (the intent)
2. Update or create the `.feature` file (the contract)
3. Failing acceptance tests drive the implementation change
