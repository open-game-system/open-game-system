# How to run the e2e suites

Every end-to-end suite in the repo, its command and what it needs. Deterministic unless noted
(no model is configured for tester-army `e2e`; no test may start a real GPU stream).

## tester-army `e2e` (`e2e/`, standalone install)

Install once: `cd e2e && pnpm install --ignore-workspace` (its own lockfile; inside the workspace a
plain `pnpm install` installs the root instead). Docs offline: `pnpm exec e2e guide [topic]`.
Run: `cd e2e && pnpm exec e2e run tests/<file>.e2e.ts --target <launcher|ios> --reporter list,markdown`.

| Flow | Test file | Target | Needs |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1. Receiver, phone path: REQUEST_VIEW until a view, LOAD_VIEW → start-stream/subscribe/answer on the sender's stream server, real frames; URL params override; no default view (it waits for a sender, never streams on its own); failed or unreachable start shows the error and stops the heartbeat | `tests/receiver-view.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | nothing running (all faked in the page) |
| 2. Receiver, laptop path: PEER_OFFER → PEER_ANSWER over Cast, loopback WebRTC frames, HUD iframe for `peer-canvas` (HUD_READY, HUD_MESSAGE), 20 s no-picture timeout → PEER_ERROR, bad offer, PEER_STOP | `tests/receiver-laptop.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | nothing running |
| 3. Receiver stops: heartbeat each minute; renderer idle stop (20 min without `__ogsActivityAt` activity, the renderer's own `isIdle`) via 410; no phone for 20 min; 3-hour cap; activity / a phone returning resets | `tests/receiver-stops.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | nothing running |
| 6. Stream full pipe: the real renderer (`services/api/container/src/server.ts`, local Chrome + capture extension, no GPU) renders a local animated page and publishes its tab over WebRTC to the receiver; the decoded frame count grows and pixels change; the renderer's idle stop (`__ogsActivityAt` → `/ping` via the API's real heartbeat route → 410) ends the cast and closes Chrome; a warm renderer serves the next cast after a stop, 8 relaunches in a row | `tests/stream-pipe.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | the container's deps installed (below); nothing else running. Opt-in `OGS_E2E_SFU=1`: Cloudflare Realtime + TURN instead of the loopback |
| Receiver logs: LOAD_VIEW received, stream started/failed, heartbeat 410, cast ended → `POST /api/v1/client-events` on its stream server's API, no token, hosts only | `tests/receiver-events.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | nothing running |
| Receiver keeps the TV awake: a screen wake lock once a stream plays (phone or laptop), taken again when dropped or on visible; the keep-awake clip when the API is missing or refuses; both let go on cast end, PEER_STOP, a failed start; `receiver.keepawake` / `receiver.visibility` events. `navigator.wakeLock` and `document.visibilityState` are faked (`openReceiver(browser, { wakeLock: "grant" \| "reject" \| "missing" })`, handle `window.__wakeLock`) | `tests/receiver-awake.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | nothing running |
| TV launcher, live session | `tests/launcher.e2e.ts`, `friends.e2e.ts`, `games-know-you.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | API (`OGS_API`, 8788), launcher (`OGS_LAUNCHER`, 5180), fixture game (`FIXTURE_GAME`, 5190) |
| API over HTTP | `tests/api.e2e.ts` | `launcher` | API (8788) |
| iOS app | `tests/app.e2e.ts`, `friends-app.e2e.ts` | `ios` | Release simulator build with `EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST=1`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_OGS_API=http://localhost:8788`; `E2E_IOS_DEVICE` / `E2E_IOS_SESSION` |

The receiver suites (flows 1–3) open `apps/web/public/receiver.html` at a routed origin
(`https://receiver.ogs.test`) with a stub of the CAF receiver SDK (`window.__cast` drives senders),
a mock stream server answered from Node whose SFU is a real `RTCPeerConnection` in a second page,
and a laptop page; every other request is aborted and must stay empty (`rx.blocked`). See
`tests/receiver-kit.ts`.

## Other suites

| Suite | Command | Needs |
|-------|---------|-------|
| TV launcher (Vitest + Playwright), incl. idle (`__ogsActivityAt` on a virtual clock) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/tv test:e2e` | builds/serves itself (`apps/tv/e2e/global-setup.ts`) |
| Mobile app (Detox) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/mobile e2e` (`e2e:build`, `e2e:test`) | `DETOX_IOS_BINARY`, `DETOX_SIM_NAME`, `E2E_OGS_API`, `FAKE_CAST`, `FAKE_CAST_2`; one stack runs every file: "The whole Detox suite on one stack" below |
| Sign in with an existing account from onboarding lands on that profile: same @id, name and sticker (`profileCardSticker-<id>`), and a relaunch skips onboarding (Detox `e2e/onboarding.test.ts`, "Sign in on a new phone restores the profile"; the code comes from the API's Local Explorer) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/mobile e2e:test -- e2e/onboarding.test.ts` | the API the build points at |
| Onboarding Back on every step, notifications undecided: welcome ⇄ notifications ⇄ profile (typed name kept), Skip → profile → Back → notifications; the sign-in sheet's Use another email (code → address) and Not now (→ the welcome) (Detox `e2e/onboarding-back.test.ts`) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/mobile e2e:test -- e2e/onboarding-back.test.ts` | the API the build points at |
| The game page's one filled button: Play with nothing to rejoin, Start game beside a sitting (whose Rejoin is outlined); the Library hero's Play over the art. Read from the pixels (`takeScreenshot`, share of lamp #ffc861) (Detox `e2e/start-game-filled.test.ts`) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/mobile e2e:test -- e2e/start-game-filled.test.ts` | API, launcher, fake Chromecast(s) (`FAKE_CAST`, `FAKE_CAST_2`) |
| Rejoin pill only on TV, Friends and Profile (not Playing or Library) (Detox `e2e/game-screen.test.ts`, `e2e/continue-lifecycle.test.ts`) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/mobile e2e:test -- e2e/game-screen.test.ts` | API, launcher, fake Chromecast |
| Play → cast prompt → Cast (Detox `e2e/play-cta.test.ts`) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/mobile e2e:test -- e2e/play-cta.test.ts` | API, launcher, fake Chromecasts (`EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST=2`) |
| The TV says "Paused" once: with the paused game's icon focused, its card focused, and on its page (counted on screen: rendered text whose middle isn't covered; the game page is opaque over Home's spotlight) (`apps/tv/e2e/launcher.e2e.ts`); the launcher's theme plays only on Home (`apps/tv/e2e/theme.e2e.ts`) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/tv test:e2e` | builds/serves itself |
| One start is one sitting (Story Nook: Play → Cast; the game's page lists one sitting, the API one instance under the couch's id) | `e2e/one-sitting.test.ts` (Detox, in apps/mobile) | the build against a local API with `CATALOGUE_START_URLS={"story-nook":"http://localhost:8821/"}`, Story Nook `pnpm dev` on 8821 (lobby only, no narration), launcher, `node fake-chromecast.mjs --port <p>` (`EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST=2`) |
| Fake Chromecast (for Detox/iOS runs) | `cd e2e && node fake-chromecast.mjs [--port 5181]` | Playwright Chromium |
| Switching TVs: 10 alternating switches, then a change of mind mid-switch (tap Bedroom, reopen "Cast to" while it switches, tap Living room: ends on Living room); after each, the hero says "Switching to <TV>…" then names the TV, and the TV's launcher header (fake Chromecast `/launcher` `roomName`) names it too (Detox `e2e/tv-switch.test.ts`) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/mobile e2e:test -- e2e/tv-switch.test.ts` | API, launcher, two fake Chromecasts (5181, 5182); a build with `EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST=2`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST_URL=http://localhost:5181/load`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST_URL_2=http://localhost:5182/load`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST_END_MS=3000` (long enough to reopen the sheet mid-switch; the fake's `/stop` closes a recording browser context, which takes seconds too, and the app waits at most 8 s for an end); `FAKE_CAST` / `FAKE_CAST_2` if not on those ports; `E2E_OGS_API` |
| Switching TVs, seam (no simulator): the cast flow + sync against two fake Chromecasts with Cast's real end timing | `cd apps/mobile && pnpm exec jest services/__tests__/cast-switch.seam.test.ts` (part of `pnpm test`) | nothing |
| Couch flow across devices | `cd e2e && node couch-flow.mjs` | API (8788), launcher (5180), fake Chromecast (5181), fixture game (5190) |
| Several households, one room (multiCouch): three couches, three recorded launchers, Night Flight; the Mumm phone in the simulator under Detox taps Invite; a Smith card moves every TV; Home/Continue on one TV; synced 2×2 video | `cd e2e && node multi-couch.mjs` (`MUMM_PHONE=scripted` without the simulator) | below |
| Every couch phone follows the TV (Rocket Crew, real room): Dad's scripted phone starts it, Mom's phone (iOS app, Detox) joins with the TV code, waits while the TV hasn't named the room, follows into `/join/<R>` (Rocket Crew's room then has Captain Dad + Fixer Mom by OGS id), steps out without parking the TV, follows Home + Continue back into the same seat, Home returns it to the remote; Juneau's iPad (scripted tablet couch client + fake WebView page, no roster) follows into the same room as the Lookout, its page's `game.view` leaves the TV page, Home/Continue/Home move it too; synced phone+TV video | `cd e2e && node phones-follow.mjs` | below |
| 4. API stream routes against a mock renderer, Realtime and TURN (start, publisher answer forwarding, subscribe/answer, heartbeat 410/502, ice-servers fallback, readiness, error contract) | `cd services/api && pnpm exec vitest run test/stream-sfu.test.ts test/stream-routes.test.ts test/stream-ready.test.ts test/stream-ready-check.test.ts` (part of `pnpm test`) | nothing (fetch stubbed) |
| 5. Post-deploy stream readiness | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/api stream:ready <apiBase>` (below) | network, `gcloud` (optional) |
| API integration (workerd) | `pnpm --filter @open-game-system/api test:integration` | emulators started by its global setup |
| Stream server container | `cd services/api/container && pnpm test` (`tsx --test`) | its deps (see Stream full pipe) |

## Stream full pipe (`e2e/tests/stream-pipe.e2e.ts`)

The real renderer on this machine, no Cloud Run, no GPU (SwiftShader), no Cloudflare by default:

```bash
# once: the renderer's deps at the image's pinned versions (it builds from package-lock.json;
# pnpm import writes an untracked pnpm-lock.yaml: don't commit it), and its Chrome for Testing
cd services/api/container && pnpm import --ignore-workspace && pnpm install --ignore-workspace --frozen-lockfile
pnpm exec puppeteer browsers install chrome
# run (each test ~10-30 s; hard limit 120 s per test)
cd e2e && pnpm exec e2e run tests/stream-pipe.e2e.ts --target launcher --reporter list,markdown
```

- Each test spawns `tsx src/server.ts` on a free port (`STREAM_IDLE_MS=4000`), a local view page
  (a canvas that cycles colour with a moving square, keeping `window.__ogsActivityAt` fresh until the
  test says nobody plays) and the receiver with `tests/receiver-kit.ts`'s stubbed Cast SDK.
- The SFU is a loopback stand-in (`renderer-kit.ts` `loopbackStreamServer`): the renderer's
  `/publisher/prepare` offer is the receiver's subscribe offer and the receiver's answer goes to
  `/publisher/answer`; host candidates only. The heartbeat runs the API's own route
  (`services/api/src/routes/stream.ts`, in process) against the renderer's `/ping`.
- `OGS_E2E_SFU=1` adds the Cloudflare leg: every stream call runs the API's routes with
  `CLOUDFLARE_REALTIME_APP_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_REALTIME_APP_SECRET`, `CLOUDFLARE_TURN_API_TOKEN` and
  `CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_ID` from the environment (never printed); missing ones skip the test by name.
  Billable (Realtime + TURN minutes), bounded by the 120 s limit.
- Cleanup: in `finally` the renderer gets SIGTERM (its shutdown closes Chrome), then SIGKILL for its
  process group and any Chrome loading this checkout's extension; a 120 s watchdog does the same if
  the test hangs. Each test then asserts no such process is left. Check by hand:
  `ps -axo pid,command | grep services/api/container`.
- The renderer starts Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` (as on Cloud Run); a local Chrome
  already listening on 127.0.0.1:9222 did not get in the way.

## Post-deploy stream readiness (no render)

`pnpm --filter @open-game-system/api stream:ready <apiBase> [--probe-renderer]`: the stream route
answers with TURN servers, `GET /api/v1/stream/ready` reports a renderer, Realtime and TURN
configured (booleans), and Cloud Run's control plane (`gcloud run services describe stream-gpu`)
says the renderer is Ready. Starts no stream and no instance. `--probe-renderer` also calls the
renderer's `/health` (no Chrome launch, but on a scaled-to-zero GPU service it cold-starts a billed
L4 instance). Hard limit 20 s; prints results only, never values.

## Several households, one room (`e2e/multi-couch.mjs`)

Everything local (no Cloud Run, no GPU, no SFU), on ports of its own so the shared 8788/5180/5181 stay
untouched:

```bash
SP=<scratch dir>
# API (8798): its own D1, Night Flight's start page local
cd services/api && pnpm exec wrangler d1 execute opengame-api-db --local --persist-to $SP/api --file=schema.sql
pnpm exec wrangler dev --port 8798 --persist-to $SP/api \
  --var 'CATALOGUE_START_URLS:{"night-flight":"http://localhost:8797/"}' --var AVATAR_BASE_URL:http://localhost:5280
# Night Flight (8797), verifying game tokens with that API
cd ~/src/night-flight-owls && pnpm exec wrangler dev --port 8797 --persist-to $SP/nf \
  --var OGS_JWKS_URL:http://localhost:8798/.well-known/jwks.json
# Launcher (5280)
pnpm --filter @open-game-system/tv build && (cd apps/tv && pnpm exec vite preview --port 5280 --strictPort)
# The app (Release, simulator) pointed at them; the script is the fake Chromecast on 5281
cd apps/mobile && EXTRA_PACKAGER_ARGS=--reset-cache EXPO_PUBLIC_OGS_API=http://localhost:8798 \
  EXPO_PUBLIC_OGS_TV=http://localhost:5280 EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST=1 EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST_URL=http://localhost:5281/load \
  xcodebuild -workspace ios/opengameapp.xcworkspace -scheme opengameapp -configuration Release \
  -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath $SP/dd -quiet
# Run (a simulator of your own)
cd e2e && DETOX_IOS_BINARY=$SP/dd/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/opengameapp.app \
  DETOX_SIM_NAME="OGS Multi-couch e2e" node multi-couch.mjs
```

The script spawns `detox test e2e/multi-couch.test.ts` (apps/mobile) and talks to it over
`/step/<name>` and `/wait/<name>` on 5281; it records the three TV contexts (Playwright `recordVideo`)
and the simulator (`simctl io recordVideo`), and writes `multi-couch-2x2.mp4`, screenshots and
`results.json` to `docs/exec-plans/active/evidence/2026-10-05-multi-couch/`.

## Every couch phone follows the TV (`e2e/phones-follow.mjs`)

Local only, on its own ports (API 8848, Rocket Crew 8847, launcher 5290, step server 5291):

```bash
SP=<scratch dir>
# API (8848): needs services/api/.dev.vars (OGS_JWT_SECRET, OGS_GAME_SIGNING_KEY), else every token is a 500
cd services/api && pnpm exec wrangler d1 execute opengame-api-db --local --persist-to $SP/api --file=schema.sql
pnpm exec wrangler dev --port 8848 --persist-to $SP/api \
  --var 'CATALOGUE_START_URLS:{"rocket-crew":"http://localhost:8847/"}' --var AVATAR_BASE_URL:http://localhost:5290
# Rocket Crew (8847), verifying game tokens with that API (needs its commits 861b22a + 4f0d1a8: ogsRoom, ogs:room)
cd ~/src/rocket-crew && pnpm exec wrangler dev --port 8847 --persist-to $SP/rc \
  --var OGS_JWKS_URL:http://localhost:8848/.well-known/jwks.json
# Launcher (5290)
pnpm --filter @open-game-system/tv build && (cd apps/tv && pnpm exec vite preview --port 5290 --strictPort)
# The app (Release, simulator) pointed at the API; Mom never casts
cd apps/mobile && EXTRA_PACKAGER_ARGS=--reset-cache EXPO_PUBLIC_OGS_API=http://localhost:8848 \
  EXPO_PUBLIC_OGS_TV=http://localhost:5290 EXPO_PUBLIC_FAKE_CAST=1 \
  xcodebuild -workspace ios/opengameapp.xcworkspace -scheme opengameapp -configuration Release \
  -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath $SP/dd -quiet
# Run (a simulator of your own)
cd e2e && DETOX_IOS_BINARY=$SP/dd/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/opengameapp.app \
  DETOX_SIM_NAME="OGS Phones-follow e2e" node phones-follow.mjs
```

It spawns `detox test e2e/phones-follow.test.ts` (apps/mobile), which reads its WebView's URL with
Detox's `web` API, and writes `results.json`, three TV screenshots and `phones-follow.mp4` (phone + TV)
to `docs/exec-plans/active/evidence/2026-10-06-phones-follow/` (`raw/` is not committed). A worktree
has no `apps/mobile/ios` (prebuild output, gitignored): copy one, including `ios/build/generated`
(the React Native codegen), or `xcodebuild` fails with "Build input file cannot be found".


## The whole Detox suite on one stack

One build and one set of local servers run every file in `apps/mobile/e2e`, the two driver scripts
included (2026-10-07: all pass this way). Ports of your own, so the shared 8788/5180/5181 stay
untouched:

```bash
SP=<scratch dir>
# A fresh worktree: build the workspace packages first (wrangler and vite resolve their dist),
# copy apps/mobile/ios from the main checkout (with ios/build/generated) and services/api/.dev.vars.

Tests that need a sitting's id read it from the API with the launcher token of the TV cast last
(`castSittings` in `apps/mobile/e2e/helpers.ts`): Detox on iOS matches ids and text by name only.
